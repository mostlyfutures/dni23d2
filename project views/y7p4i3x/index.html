                <div class="prose prose-custom max-w-none">
                    <p>A "dark pool" is a private trading venue where financial instruments are traded anonymously, with the order book hidden from the public. This confidentiality prevents front-running and minimizes the market impact of large orders. However, building such a system in a decentralized, trustless, and cost-free manner presents a significant challenge.</p>
                    <p>This document outlines the software architecture for a novel Dark Pool DEX designed to operate with zero setup and operational costs for the developer. The project's objective is to create an accessible, private, and efficient trading system by leveraging the unique capabilities of Constellation's Hypergraph, a custom privacy layer, and free-tier cloud infrastructure.</p>

                <div class="prose prose-custom max-w-none mb-8">
                    <p>The choice of underlying ledger technology is critical. After a comparative analysis between zk-Rollups and Constellation's DAG, Constellation was selected as the optimal foundation. While zk-Rollups offer superior native privacy, they incur prohibitive deployment and operational costs. Constellation's model, though requiring significant engineering effort to create a custom privacy layer, provides a viable path to a zero-cost setup.</p>

                    <p>The architecture segregates responsibilities into three core components to achieve lean off-chain coordination and secure on-chain settlement. This design minimizes the on-chain footprint, which is key to leveraging Constellation's free usage potential.</p>

                        <li><strong>Frontend Interface:</strong> A static web app where users interact and perform all client-side cryptographic operations, ensuring private keys never leave their browser.</li>

                        <li><strong>On-Chain Settlement Layer:</strong> A custom Metagraph on the Constellation Hypergraph that acts as the decentralized trust anchor. It manages collateral via state channels and atomically settles trades only upon receiving valid signatures from both parties.</li>

                <div class="prose prose-custom max-w-none mb-8">
                    <p>Since DAG protocols are not inherently private, a custom privacy layer is the most critical architectural component. We employ a two-stage cryptographic protocol, the **Commit-Reveal scheme**, to ensure order confidentiality from both the public and the matching engine operator until the moment of execution.</p>

                        <li><strong>Commitment Phase:</strong> The user generates a cryptographic hash (commitment) of their order details plus a secret nonce. Only this commitment is sent to the engine, preventing the operator from knowing the order's specifics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reveal Phase:</strong> After the commitment is logged, the user encrypts the full order details using the engine's public key (via ECIES) and sends the encrypted payload.</li>
                        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> The engine decrypts the payload and verifies that its hash matches the original commitment. This ensures the user cannot change their order after commitment, securing the integrity of the matching process.</li>

                        <li><strong>Secure Trading API:</strong> Programmatic traders are provided a RESTful API for order submission and management. All requests must be cryptographically signed using an HMAC-SHA256 signature, ensuring authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. The API endpoints are designed to seamlessly follow the Commit-Reveal privacy protocol.</li>
