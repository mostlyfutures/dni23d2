```

Deployment information is saved to `deployments/{network}.json`

## Step 2: Bridge API Integration

### 2.1 Test Bridge APIs
```bash
# Test bridge integration
npm run bridge:test
```

Expected output:
```
🧪 Testing Bridge API Integration...

1️⃣ Testing quote retrieval...
✅ Retrieved 4 quotes:
   1. constellation: $0 (1 min)
   2. layerzero: $0.012 (2 min)
   3. multichain: $0.01 (5 min)
   4. stargate: $0.015 (3 min)
```

### 2.2 Bridge Configuration
The system supports multiple bridges with automatic routing:

| Bridge | Base Fee | Volume Discounts | Best For |
|--------|----------|------------------|----------|
| Constellation | $0.00 | None | Free swaps |
| LayerZero | $0.012 | 20-30% | Fast swaps |
| Multichain | $0.01 | 10-20% | Large volumes |
| Stargate | $0.015 | 15-25% | Stable routes |

### 2.3 Bridge API Endpoints
```javascript
// Get quotes from all bridges
const quotes = await bridgeAPIs.getQuotes({
  fromChainId: 1,
  toChainId: 137,
  fromToken: 'QNT',
  toToken: 'RENDER',
  amount: '1000000000000000000',
  userAddress: '0x...'
});

// Execute bridge transaction
const result = await bridgeAPIs.executeBridgeTransaction(
  'constellation',
  quote,
  userAddress
);
```

## Step 3: Real-Time Cost Monitoring

### 3.1 Start Cost Monitoring
```bash
# Start monitoring service
npm run start:monitoring
```

### 3.2 Monitor Cost Performance
The cost monitor tracks:
- **Target Achievement**: Percentage of swaps under $0.015
- **Average Cost**: Overall cost per swap
- **Bridge Performance**: Cost and success rate by bridge
- **Optimization Triggers**: Automatic suggestions for cost reduction

### 3.3 Cost Analysis
```bash
# Analyze cost performance
npm run cost:analyze
```

Expected output:
```
📊 Cost Analysis:
  Total Swaps: 150
  Average Cost: $0.0134
  Target Achievement: 87.3%
  Total Savings: $0.0240

🌉 Bridge Performance Analysis:
  constellation:
    Average Cost: $0.0000
    Success Rate: 100.0%
  layerzero:
    Average Cost: $0.0120
    Success Rate: 95.2%
```

### 3.4 Optimization Triggers
The system automatically triggers optimizations when:
- **Route Selection**: Cost > 2x target
- **Batch Size**: Cost 1.5-2x target
- **Volume Discount**: Cost 1.2-1.5x target
- **Gas Optimization**: Cost 1-1.2x target

## Integration Testing

### 4.1 Run Full Integration Test
```bash
# Test all components together
npm run bridge:test
```

### 4.2 Test Scenarios
1. **Low Cost Swap**: $0.008 (Constellation bridge)
2. **Medium Cost Swap**: $0.025 (Triggers optimization)
3. **High Cost Swap**: $0.05 (Triggers high priority optimization)

### 4.3 Expected Results
- **Target Achievement**: >80% of swaps under $0.015
- **Average Cost**: <$0.02 per swap
- **Bridge Performance**: Constellation leading with 0 cost
- **Optimization Triggers**: Active for high-cost swaps

## Production Deployment

### 5.1 Security Analysis
```bash
# Run security checks
npm run security:coverage
```

### 5.2 Performance Validation
```bash
# Validate cost targets in production
npm run cost:analyze
```

### 5.3 Monitoring Setup
- Set up alerts for cost threshold breaches
- Monitor bridge performance and success rates
- Track optimization trigger effectiveness

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 6.1 Batch Processing
- **Minimum Batch Size**: 5 swaps
- **Optimal Batch Size**: 20-50 swaps
- **Cost Reduction**: 60-80% per swap

### 6.2 Route Optimization
- **Constellation Priority**: Free bridge for supported routes
- **L2 Networks**: Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism for lower gas
- **Volume Discounts**: Negotiate with bridge providers

### 6.3 Gas Optimization
- **Transaction Batching**: Group multiple operations
- **Gas Price Monitoring**: Use optimal gas prices
- **Network Selection**: Choose networks with lower gas costs

## Troubleshooting

### 7.1 Common Issues

**Deployment Fails**
```bash
# Check network connectivity
npx hardhat console --network polygon-mumbai

# Verify private key
echo $PRIVATE_KEY | wc -c
```

**Bridge API Errors**
```bash
# Test individual bridge
node -e "const { bridgeAPIs } = require('./src/services/BridgeAPIs'); bridgeAPIs.getQuotes({...})"
```

**Cost Monitoring Issues**
```bash
# Check monitoring logs
npm run start:monitoring

# Export cost data for analysis
node -e "const { costMonitor } = require('./src/services/CostMonitor'); console.log(costMonitor.exportCostData())"
```

### 7.2 Performance Issues
- **High Costs**: Check bridge configurations and volume discounts
- **Slow Swaps**: Verify network congestion and gas prices
- **Failed Transactions**: Review error logs and retry mechanisms

## Next Steps

### 8.1 Advanced Features
- **FHE Privacy**: Implement fully homomorphic encryption
- **MEV Protection**: Add sandwich attack prevention
- **Institutional Trading**: Large order management
- **Advanced Routing**: Multi-hop bridge optimization

### 8.2 Scaling Considerations
- **Volume Growth**: Monitor batch sizes and processing times
- **Bridge Capacity**: Ensure sufficient liquidity across bridges
- **Cost Management**: Maintain $0.01-0.02 target as volume increases

### 8.3 Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Daily**: Review cost statistics and optimization triggers
- **Weekly**: Analyze bridge performance and negotiate discounts
- **Monthly**: Update routing strategies and bridge configurations
